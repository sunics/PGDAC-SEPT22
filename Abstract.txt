                              (Based on Blood Bank)
                                  ABSTRACT
In India, blood bank management services are mostly hospital-based. In a hospital
based blood management service, each hospital runs its own blood collection programme with
or without central regulation. This system utilizes existing institutions and enables transfer of
stocks of blood locally in general and emergency requirements. As the organization of
voluntary blood donation in hospital-based system is usually unsatisfactory, replacement
donors form the main source of blood supply in the hospital. Replacement donors are usually
friends and family members of the patient and are under pressure to donate blood. A voluntary
donor system is far more satisfactory as there is no compulsion and the donor is motivated to
donate blood. Which is why donors are listed on our application help in such situations who
donates on their will and urgent demands of patients/attendants/hospitals. Needing Hospitals
can easily find stock in other hospitals which will help the patients and relieves the stress of
finding the blood randomly in the nearby blood banks. Blood donation camp organizers can
also freely approach to get listed with their schedules which will further enhance the
communication ability to reach out to more donors.
